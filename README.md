short information
------------------
  In this paper, IWR6843 radar device is used. This millimeter-wave radar allows to work in the frequency band of 60GHz and has good range resolution and velocity resolution. The radar is set to three-transmit and four-receive mode, a total of 12 channels of data are obtained. In this paper, the data of one channel is taken as the original signal. this dataset collected in this paper consists of 41 volunteers, including 22 boys and 19 girls,Their weight was between 50 kg and 70 kg, and their height was between 160 cm and 180 cm. In order to make the application scenario closer to real life, volunteers walk freely in the radio frequency range, collects his data at different times and different weather separately, so as to consider the influence of environmental factors such as different clothing and shoes.In the first stage, the data of 41 volunteers walking freely in the same scene were recorded for about 4 minutes. In the second stage, one week later, the same type of equipment was deployed from different angles and the same volunteers were recorded in the same scene for 4 minutes. data in minutes.The entire  dataset recorded radio frequency information of volunteers walking freely for nearly 6 hours, about 8 minutes per person.
  
  The Images folder contains about 30 minutes of Doppler speed data for five pedestrians, the raw datas of 5 people is provided here [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/158GpwBDjoTkkZ37O0bDtKxVlogBrAxl2),where the first number on the file name represents the pedestrian tag,the second number is the Angle number, the third number is the group number.
