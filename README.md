mmReIData
============
  `mmReIData`: Pedestrian re-identification dataset based on mmWave radio frequency signal.
  

Short Information
------------------
 mmReIData is a mmWave signal dataset for person re-identification (Re-ID). The dataset is the raw FMCW Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal sampled data collected by two COTS Texas Instruments (TI) IWR6843 radar devices from two different days and positions of 41 pedestrians. 
  
  Currently, the ‘/images’ folder contains about 30 minutes of Doppler speed data for five pedestrians.  The raw RF IF signal sampled data of five people is provided [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/158GpwBDjoTkkZ37O0bDtKxVlogBrAxl2).
  
  The entire 41 volunteers’ raw RF dataset will be publicly released soon.
